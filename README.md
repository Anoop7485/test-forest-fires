 Forest Fire Area Prediction using Regression
 Project Overview

Forest fires are a major natural hazard that cause environmental and economic damage. This project aims to predict the burned area of forest fires based on meteorological and environmental conditions using regression techniques.

By analyzing features like temperature, humidity, wind, and rainfall, the model provides insights into the factors influencing forest fire spread and severity.

 Objectives

Predict the burned area of forest fires using machine learning regression models.

Compare the performance of different regression algorithms.

Understand the influence of environmental factors on fire spread.
